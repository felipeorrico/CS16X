Name: Felipe Orrico Scognamiglio

Program Description: This program is an implementation of the Linked List Class.
The use of provided function definitions was mandatory and we were not allowed to modify it.
We had liberty to decide how to implement every function, the only requirement was that the sort_ascending function
had to be implemented using a merge sort algorithm that would change the addresses, not the values in the list.

Some modifications in the flow of the program were made to meet those criteria compared to the flow charts that are present
in the design file. 

*When checking if the other functions work, you might need to use the functions located in the List_Program.h file. In any
case, you can always implement a test in the run() function.

*It took a little bit to realize how to go through the values in a linked list, after that, I just had to get my sorting algorithms
from lab and convert it so that it would sort the linked list.

No extra-credit work was implemented in this assignment.
