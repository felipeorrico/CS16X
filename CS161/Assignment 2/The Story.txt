Assignment 2 - Boss Fight Level

*Welcome to the Boss Fight Level! Please input your desired name.
*Hello player_name you are the Elder Spell caster of the vast lands of Arcadia.
*There are two structures ahead of you. One is a BIG DARK CASTLE, the other is the
entrance to a COAL MINE. 
*Do you want to enter the BIG DARK CASTLE or the COAL MINE?
*Enter 1 to enter the BIG DARK CASTLE or 2 to enter the COAL MINE:
	-If 1:
	*You choose to enter the BIG DARK CASTLE.
	*You go inside and you see a red light in the distance. You start walking towards it
	and enter what looks like a church inside. The doors of the church close behind you,
	and you can hear what could only sound like the cry of a baby. As you get closer to the
	Altar the high pitch cry gets more intense, when you reach the altar a blinding red light
	begins to shine and moves towards you. The crying stops and a very deep voice begins to
	talk to you. 'Hello player_name, I've been expecting you!'.
	The Creature grabs you by your neck and says 'Now we can finish this once and for all' then
	throws you away and you hit a wall.

		something that small can hurt me? you haven't seen anything!' After the Smoke clears you
		can see what the creature looks like. The creature is a Massive Gummy bear.  'It's now my
		turn, you fool!'
