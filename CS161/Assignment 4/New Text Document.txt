Ensure:


● If the user enters an invalid guess (i.e. not a letter), you should prompt
them for input again.

● Your user interface must provide clear instructions for the user as well
as information about the current state of the game.

● The word should be the only thing hardcoded in your program. Do not
hardcode length or the number of attempts.


IDEAS:

- to check if string has number transofrm string to int and check for zero or different than 0.

- create string with numbers and use that co compare with guess string to check if it contains numbers, if it does, prompt again, if does not, proceed.
- use same idea above to check for !@#$%^&*- inside the word and display right away.
